# EPSON ePOS XML Editor
This is the editor provided by EPSON for their ePOS XML format used to programatically print on their printers.

[franciscohanna92](https://github.com/franciscohanna92/epson-epos-xml-editor) found it at at https://c4b.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=single_soft&cid=6558&scat=47&pcat=52 and the docs are unfortunately not online anymore. Since he isn't hosting it anymore, I decided to upload the editor myself.
